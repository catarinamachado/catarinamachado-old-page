Hi! My name is <b>Catarina</b> and I'm a <b>19-year-old student</b> in the 2nd year of the Computer Software Engineering course at University of Minho.

My goal is to do excel in everything I do, at all times, regardless of what it may take.
Ever since I've been familiarized with the concept of <b>programming</b>, I knew this was what I wanted my career to be based on and, as my academic journey progresses, I'm increasingly sure that Informatics is the scientific and professional universe in which I want to take part for life.

I love <b>challenges</b> and I'm greatly inspired by the extent of knowledge there is still for me to acquire and by the room for personal improvement that such constitutes.
