“Bomberman” was a school project made in the 1st semester (Oct 2016 – Jan 2017) of the 1st year of the Computer Software Engineering course at Computer Labs I. 

The project consists on small Haskell applications that should respond to different tasks. The goal is to implement the classic Bomberman game in battle mode. The overall idea of the game is to strategically place bombs to kill enemies and destroy obstacles on the map. 

So, it was a game programed in Haskell and contributed to a greater practice of this functional programming language. It also contributed to deepening our knowledge of LaTeX, because we had to make a final report of the work. 

It was a pair assignment and we got a final grade of 17.
