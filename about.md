Hi! My name is Catarina and I’m 19 years old. Currently I’m on 2nd year in the Computer Software Engineering course at University of Minho.

My goal is to do my best in everything I do.

Since i meet programming i knew there is it i want to do in my daily life and is on the informatics area that i want to be involved forever.

I love challenges, and what inspires me is the fact that is a billion of things to learn and i want to learn as much that i can, and overcome myself every day.
