In the 2nd semester of my 1st year (Feb 2017 – Jun 2017) in the Computer Software Engineering course, I had a project in the Computer Labs II curricular unit called “Roguelike”.

This project consisted of implementing a Coffeebreak Roguelike game characterized by having simple rules, being quick to play and being particularly deadly.

The project implementation was done in a CGI in C, in the Linux operating system. We also used a little HTML and CSS.

It was a three-person project and we had a grade of 19.

Check out the Roguelike's project [here][roguelike].
